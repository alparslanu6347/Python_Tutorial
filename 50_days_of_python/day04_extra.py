# Write a function called word_index that takes one argument,
# a list of strings and returns the index of the longest word in the
# list. If there is no longest word (if all the strings are of the same
# length), the function should return zero (0). For example, the list
# below should return 2.
# words1 = ["Hate", "remorse", "vengeance"]
#  And this list below, shoul return zero (0)
# words2 = ["Love", "Hate"]

    return list.index(i)
