#  Odd and Even
# Write a function called odd_even that has one parameter and
# takes a list of numbers as an argument. The function returns the
# difference between the largest even number in the list and the
# smallest odd number in the list. For example, if you pass
# [1,2,4,6] as an argument the function should return 6 -1= 5.
